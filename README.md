# QUIZZ-APP
Quizz-app is a web application that allows the player to test their knowledge in a difficult challenge that consists of testing their criteria and intelligence to solve the questions in a certain time.

## Instructions
The application consists of a questionnaire with 5 questions, from which the user can choose a free subject. Each question has two game modes, the "Multiple Choise" mode and the "Direct Answer" mode. If the user decides to answer using the first mode, he will earn 2 points. If he chooses the second, he will earn 5 points. Failure to hit either of the two modes will earn him 0 points. The maximum is 25 points.
                                                
The themes to choose from are:

* Politics.
* Sports.
* Music.

The ranking of scores will be shown at the end.
